Project Overview

The State Medical Bot is an intelligent medical assistant designed to help users with their medical queries. By integrating a Large Language Model (LLM), this bot understands user questions related to medicines and health conditions, and provides clear, concise, and helpful answers.

Problem Statement

People often struggle to get quick and reliable information about medicines and their uses, especially for common symptoms like fever. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering an interactive medical bot that:

Understands user queries in natural language.

Provides accurate information about medicines, their uses, and related health advice.

Delivers responses with clear explanations to aid understanding.

How It Works

User Query: The user asks a medical question, such as "What medicine should I use for fever?"

Query Processing: The query is sent to the integrated Large Language Model (LLM).

LLM Response: The LLM processes the query and generates a detailed, context-aware answer.

Client Display: The response is sent back to the client interface and displayed to the user in an easy-to-understand format.

Features

Natural language understanding of medical queries.

Integration with powerful LLM for accurate and contextual responses.

User-friendly interface for easy communication.

Focused on medicine-related questions and health guidance.
